# Logistic-Portfolio
Logistics projects that illustrate my ability to analyze and interpret both exploratory and geographic data for real-world insights.

## Projects

* ### Project: [Geographical Service Area Definition](https://github.com/JonnyNguyen005/Logistic-Portfolio/blob/main/Service%20Area%20Optimization/README.md)
  * **Description:** This project defines realistic service areas for five logistics hubs using customer addresses and postal code boundaries. It visualizes the natural catchment zones per site based on customer clusters and administrative regions, leveraging MyMaps and shapefile overlays.
  * **Geospatial Skills Used:** Territory segmentation, KML import, visual clustering, ZIP-level analysis.

* ### Project: Economic Reachability via Isochrones
  * **Description:** This project identifies economically viable dispatch zones for disposal services based on actual 60-minute road travel times. It includes 5 locations and visualizes cost-efficient coverage using real isochrones calculated via OpenRouteService.
  * **Geospatial & Analytical Skills Used:** Travel-time modeling, route-based zone creation, realistic business constraints (on-site time, return buffer), map visualization.
